## Work Around Current Issues
### Work around [Issue #34](https://github.com/Salesforce-org-Impact-Labs/FinAid/issues/34)
#### Issue Summary
The bot's **Bot User** setting must be set to a **Custom Chatbot User** instead of **Basic Chatter User** in order to have access to Salesforce Knowledge. The **Custom Chatbot User** setting requires a user with access to Knowledge to be specified. However, committing this configuration to the repo, can cause problems when deploying from the repo with a message such as:

>_Invalid value for Bot User field given. ERROR running force:source:push: Push failed_

#### Work-Around

Do the pre- and post-deployment steps in this section if the bot was committed to the repo with the `Bot User` setting set to a `Custom Chatbot User`, which when enabled requires a user to be specified. This is the case if element  `<botUser>USER_NAME</botUser>` element exists in `Alpha1.bot-meta.xml` metadata file under `force-app/main/default/bots`
##### Pre-Deployment
Manually delete the following element  `<botUser>USER_NAME</botUser>` from `Alpha1.bot-meta.xml` metadata file under `force-app/main/default/bots`

##### Post-Deployment
Reconfigure the bot to set the **Bot User** setting to a **Custom Chatbot User** and specify a user that has access to Knowledge, which the bot requires. Note that the bot must be deactivated in order to edit settings.

To get to the page shown in the image above,
1. Go to **Setup -> Feature Settings -> Service -> Service Cloud Einstein -> Einstein Bots** or search for "bot" in **Setup -> Quick Find** and click **Einstein Bots" to bring up the **Einstein Bots** page
2. On the **Eintein Bots** page, go to the **My Bots** section (_you may have to scroll down the page_) and click on the bot version you want to edit, e.g., **Version 3**. This brings up the **Einstein Bot Builder** page.
3. On the **Einstein Bot Builder** page, bring up the **Overview** page using the pick list on the top left corner of the pagge. Set the **Bot User** setting to use a **Custom Chatbot User** and specify a user that has access to Knowledge.

### Work around issue [Issue #36](https://github.com/Salesforce-org-Impact-Labs/FinAid/issues/36)
#### Issue Summary

Deployment using `cci flow run dev_org --org dev` (when creating a dev scratch org) and `sfdx force:source:deploy` fails with the error message below when using Article Answers

>_Invocation Target ID: bad value for restricted picklist field: generateKnowledgeLogData_

The deployment succeeds and the message disappears if the **Article Answers** dialog's **Generate Knowledge Feedback Log** action is deleted.

#### Work-Around

Do the following work around **if and only if** a bot version you want to deploy uses  **Article Answers**.

##### Pre-Deployment
Manually delete the **Article Answers** dialog's **Generate Knowledge Feedback Log** action in the `v3.botVersion-meta.xml` metadata file.

1. Locate the **Article Answers** dialog. Search for `<label>Article Answers</label>` in the `v3.botVersion-meta.xml` metadata file or whichever version of the bot you're trying to deploy under `force-app/main/default/bots`.
2. In the **Article Answers** dialog, locate `<botSteps>` that has the **Generate Knowledge Feedback Log** action and delete it. It should look something like the XML block below.
3. Repeat steps above for all versions that use **Article Answers** you want to deploy.
```   
<botDialogs>
    <botSteps>
        <botInvocation>
            <invocationActionName>generateKnowledgeLogData</invocationActionName>
            <invocationActionType>logFeedback</invocationActionType>
        </botInvocation>
        ...
    </botSteps>
    ...
    <description>Article Answers (Beta) can be used instead of the FAFSA Terms dialog</description>
    <developerName>Answer_Automation</developerName>
    <label>Article Answers</label>
    <showInFooterMenu>false</showInFooterMenu>
</botDialogs>
```
##### Post-Deployment
Restore the **Article Answers** dialog's **Generate Knowledge Feedback Log** action as shown in the image below. Do this for every metadata file from which it was manually deleted, e.g., `v3.botVersion-meta.xml` metadata file.

The action should be right after the **Was this useful?** question action of the **Article Answers** dialog. Basically, it just logs the user's answer to the question and its context.

To get to the page shown in the image above,
1. Go to **Setup -> Feature Settings -> Service -> Service Cloud Einstein -> Einstein Bots** or search for "bot" in **Setup -> Quick Find** and click **Einstein Bots" to bring up the **Einstein Bots** page
2. On the **Eintein Bots** page, go to the **My Bots** section and click on the FAFSA Bot version you want to edit, e.g., **Version 3**. This brings up the **Einstein Bot Builder** page.
3. On the **Einstein Bot Builder** page, switch to **Dialogs** using the pick list on the top left corner. Find the **Article Answers** dialog and click on it to edit it and add a **Generate Knowledge Feedback Log** action right after the the **Was this useful?** question action. NOTE: You have to deactivate the bot to edit.
